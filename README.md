A command line application to use daily to help me stay on top of projects and chores, and to provide prompts for daily journaling.

It will do the following:

1. Select a household chore to do that I don't already do daily, weighted by its priority (higher = more frequently picked)
2. Select 10 flashcards from a topic to review (and append topic to .txt file to keep track of reviewed topics)
3. Generate a poetry prompt for a short free writing session
4. Pull a previous day's entry for review before writing a short journal entry
5. Collect the poetry freewrite and the journal entry into .md file and add it to Obsidian notebook
6. Print out current state of projects (track progress in json)
